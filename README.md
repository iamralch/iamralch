# whoami

Over the years, I've led engineering teams, scaled products, and helped shape strategies that bridge technology with business goals. My work sits at the intersection of vision and execution, where innovation meets delivery.

My journey spans healthcare, fintech, sports technology, logistics, cloud platforms, and developer tools. These diverse experiences have sharpened my ability to see patterns across industries, anticipate challenges, and deliver solutions that not only work at scale but also stand the test of time. Whether building from the ground up or steering established teams, I focus on clarity, adaptability, and long-term value.  

At heart, I believe in creating products and cultures that last. I’m passionate about mentoring, driving innovation, and connecting technology with people in meaningful ways. If you’re here looking for code, ideas, or collaboration, you’re in the right place.
