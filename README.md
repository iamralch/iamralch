# whoami

I’ve spent my career building software that does more than just run—it solves real problems and delivers value. What drives me is the chance to work with talented people, grow engineering teams, and turn ambitious ideas into products that make an impact.  

Along the way, I’ve worked across healthcare, fintech, sports technology, logistics, cloud services, and developer tooling. Each field has added new perspectives on how to design systems, scale platforms, and ship technology that holds up under real-world demands.  

I care about clarity, adaptability, and building solutions that last. I’m open to collaborations where goals truly align—and outside of that, I like to keep things clean, simple, and focused.
